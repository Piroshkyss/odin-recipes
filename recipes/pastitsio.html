    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pastitsio (Greek: παστίτσιο, pastítsio) is a classic Greek baked pasta dish, often compared to lasagna but with
        its own unique Mediterranean character. It features layers of tubular pasta (traditionally bucatini or penne), a
        rich and aromatic ground meat sauce spiced with cinnamon and cloves, and a thick, creamy béchamel sauce on top.
        The dish is assembled in distinct layers and baked until golden, resulting in a hearty, comforting casserole
        with a signature blend of savory, spiced, and creamy flavors

        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried basil</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon allspice</li>
        <li>2–3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water (for sauce)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 cups whole milk (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper (for béchamel)</li>
        <li>2 cups grated parmesan or kefalograviera cheese</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Olive oil or butter for greasing the baking dish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F).</li>
        <li>Boil the pasta in salted water until just al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Sauté onions (and carrot/celery if using) until soft.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook for another minute. Stir in the ground beef and cook until browned.</li>
        <li>Pour in the red wine, let it simmer until mostly evaporated.</li>
        <li>Add canned tomatoes, tomato paste, salt, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, basil, allspice, bay leaves, sugar, and
            water. Simmer uncovered for 20–30 minutes until thickened. Remove bay leaves.</li>
        <li>For the béchamel: In a saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour to form a paste. Gradually
            add milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Cook, stirring, until thickened.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat. Whisk in nutmeg, pepper, cheese, and beaten eggs quickly (so eggs don’t scramble).</li>
        <li>Grease a large baking dish. Layer half the pasta on the bottom. Optionally, toss pasta with a little cheese
            and egg white for binding.</li>
        <li>Spread all the meat sauce evenly over the pasta layer.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining pasta on top of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Pour the béchamel sauce over the top layer of pasta, smoothing it with a spatula. Sprinkle with extra
            cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 40–50 minutes until the top is golden and set. Let it cool for at least 20–30 minutes before
            slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
