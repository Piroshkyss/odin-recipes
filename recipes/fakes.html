    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fakes (Greek: Φακές, pronounced fah-KESS) is a classic Greek lentil soup known for its hearty, comforting, and
        nutritious qualities. This rustic dish features lentils simmered with vegetables like onion, carrot, and celery
        in a tomato-based broth, seasoned with bay leaves, herbs, and olive oil. Fakes is a staple in Greek households,
        especially during colder months or fasting periods, and is often served with a drizzle of olive oil, a splash of
        vinegar, and fresh bread

        <li>1–2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1–2 cups canned crushed tomatoes or tomato puree</li>
        <li>¼–½ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper, to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sort through the lentils to remove any debris, then rinse well. Optionally, soak them in lukewarm water for
            1 hour and drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing for 1–2 minutes
            until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the diced carrots and celery. Sauté for another 3–5 minutes until slightly softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the lentils, crushed tomatoes or tomato puree, bay leaves, and water or vegetable stock. Bring to a
            gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45–60 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add more water if needed
            to reach your desired soup consistency.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, black pepper, and oregano (if using). Simmer until the lentils are tender and the flavors
            meld.</li>
        <li>Remove the bay leaves. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, drizzled with extra olive oil and a splash of red wine vinegar. Garnish with fresh herbs and
            chili flakes if desired. Enjoy with crusty bread.</li>
